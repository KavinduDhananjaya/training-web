            <p>In Angular, a module is a mechanism to group components, directives, pipes and services that are related,
                in such a way that can be combined with other modules to create an application.
                An Angular application can be thought of as a
                puzzle where each piece (or each module) is needed to be able to see the full picture.</p>
